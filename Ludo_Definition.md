## Ludo Definition

After researching different interpretations of Ludo, I propose my own definition of its rules, divided into two categories:

* **Strict Ludo Rule Set**: a foundational rule set that defines what most *common* Ludo games share.
* **Loose Ludo Rule Set**: a minimal rule set containing only the essential elements required for a game to still be considered Ludo.

This project will initially follow the **Strict Ludo Rule Set**, and will gradually relax constraints until it reaches the **Loose Ludo** definition.

The rules presented here are **arbitrary and opinion-based**. Different interpretations are valid, and others may disagree on what should be considered “Strict Ludo”.

Each Rule is supposed to only contain one fundamental information about the game
