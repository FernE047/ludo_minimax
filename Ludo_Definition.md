## Ludo Definition

After researching different interpretations of Ludo, I propose my own definition of its rules, divided into two categories:

* **Strict Ludo Rule Set**: a foundational rule set that defines what most *common* Ludo games share.
* **Loose Ludo Rule Set**: a minimal rule set containing only the essential elements required for a game to still be considered Ludo.

This project will initially follow the **Strict Ludo Rule Set**, and will gradually relax constraints until it reaches the **Loose Ludo** definition.

The rules presented here are **arbitrary and opinion-based**. Different interpretations are valid, and others may disagree on what should be considered “Strict Ludo”.

Each Rule is supposed to only contain one fundamental information about the game

## Strict Ludo

1. Ludo is a **board game**.
2. It is played by **2 to 4 players**.
3. Each player is assigned a **unique color**.
4. The game is played on a **cyclical board**.

6. Each player has **exactly 4 markers** of their own color.
7. A player may only move **markers they own**.
8. All markers are **provided by the game**.
9. Each marker goes through **four distinct phases** during the game: **Start**, **Path**, **End Path**, and **Finish**.
10. Each player has their own **Start**, **End Path**, and **Finish**, all associated with their color.
11. Only a player’s own markers may use their **Start**, **End Path**, and **Finish**.
12. A player **wins** by placing **all of their markers** on their respective **Finish**.
13. Ludo is a **turn-based game**.
14. A player may only act **during their own turn**.
15. The game is played using **one or two dice**.
16. Turn order is decided by **rolling the dice** before the game starts.
17. The player with the **highest roll** goes first.
18. If a tie occurs for the highest roll, the tied players must **roll again**.
19. This process repeats until the tie is broken, determining the order among tied players.
20. At the start of the game, all markers are placed on the **Start**.
21. Markers **cannot move while on the Start**.
22. To remove a marker from the Start, the player must **roll a 6**.
23. When a player rolls a 6, they may either **remove a marker from the Start** or **move a marker already on the Path**.
24. Markers on the **Path** may move.
25. Markers move **clockwise** along the Path.
26. Markers move forward a number of tiles **equal to the dice roll**.
27. When a player rolls a number **other than 6**, they must move a marker already on the Path.
28. If a marker lands on a tile occupied by an **opponent’s marker**, the opponent’s marker is **captured** and returned to its Start.
29. A marker may only enter its **End Path** from the tile **immediately before it**.
30. A marker may only enter its **Finish** from the **last tile of its End Path**.
31. A marker may only move into the Finish if the **dice roll is exact**.
32. When playing with two dice, **each die is resolved separately**.
33. When playing with two dice, the player may **choose the order** in which the dice are resolved.
34. The **End Path** consists of **4 or 5 tiles**.
35. The **Finish** consists of **a single tile**.
36. The **Path** contains **(End Path size × 2 + 3) × 4 tiles**.
